# Economic Impacts of Sea Level Rise on Coastal Real Estate

## Background

Here’s a little background to explain the motivations for this project.

Over the last 150 years, or since the dawn of the industrial age, the world temperature has been rising.  Not just rising at a standard rate of change, but at a rate relatively fast compared to historical measurements. The primary drivers of this temperature increase are greenhouse gases, like CO2 and methane.  These gases absorb and emit thermal radiation (heat) and have increased significantly over the last century.

So why is this relevant to our sea-level rise project?
The world's seas have absorbed more than 90 percent of the heat trapped by these gases, and that’s had some consequences. Average sea levels have swelled over 8 inches (about 23 cm) since 1880, and for some perspective, that’s shortly after the civil war.   Now within that timeframe about three of those inches gained in the last 25 years (or in other words, the time since Forest Gump was released). Presently the rate of sea rise is 0.13 inches (3.2 mm) per year. The average annual rate of global sea level rise accelerated from 1993 - 2008, increasing 65 - 90 percent above the twentieth century average.

The main drivers of sea level rise are:

- Thermal expansion: Water expands when heated and about half of the sea level rise over the past 25 years is attributed to warmer oceans simply occupying more space 
- Melting glaciers: Large ice formations such as mountain glaciers naturally melt a bit each summer. In the winter, snows-primarily from evaporated seawater- are generally sufficient to balance out the melting. However, recently persistently higher temperatures from climate change have led to greater-than-average summer melting as well as less snowfall from later winters and earlier springs. This created an imbalance between runoff and evaporation
- Loss of ice sheets: Land ice- glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets- is shrinking at a faster rate in response to rising temperatures, adding water to the world’s oceans

## Objectives:

- Identify and quantify real estate within New Hanover County that will experience increased flood risks as sea level rises
- What is the potential loss in monetary value of properties within flood zones by zip-code

    -For different increments of  sea level change
    
    -Over certain periods of time
- What is the difference in property value predictions without sea level rise vs. with the predicted sea level rise
- Create an interactive map displaying our results
